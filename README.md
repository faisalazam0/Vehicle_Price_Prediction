# Predict Vehicle Prices 🚗💰

This project builds a machine learning model to predict used vehicle prices based on specifications such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains vehicle listings with the following features:
- make, model, year
- engine, cylinders, fuel, mileage
- transmission, body style, trim
- exterior & interior colors
- drivetrain
- target: `price` (in USD)

## 🧠 ML Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
2. Categorical Encoding & Feature Scaling
3. Model Training (Random Forest)
4. Evaluation (RMSE & R² Score)

## 📈 Results
- RMSE: ~7781 USD
- R² Score: ~0.80

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
